INSTRUCTIONS FOR SCRAPING:

1. Go to: https://icmixed.tenniscores.com/
2. Select the desired Season (e.g., 2024).
3. Select the Division Group (e.g., Majors, A Division, B Division, C Division, etc.)
4. Select any specific Division inside that Group (e.g., Majors West, East Central 1, etc.)
   (âœ… You do NOT have to select the first/top division â€” any division inside the group works.)
5. Click on the "Matches" tab to load the matches page.
6. Copy the full URL from your browser â€” this will be your entry URL.
7. Use that URL when calling `scrape_season_divisions(entry_url)`.

Note:
- The scraper will automatically detect and loop through ALL divisions inside the selected Division Group.
- The selected Season and Division Group must match what you want to scrape.
